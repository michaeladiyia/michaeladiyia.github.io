    <h2 class="dropdown-heading" onclick="toggleDropdown('it-projects')">IT Projects</h2>
    <div class="dropdown-content" id="it-projects">
      <ul>
        <li>Designed and implemented a user interface for a platform to help international students navigate through university education experience in York University.</li>
        <li>Created a single-page diet dashboard application using Angular. Various functionalities such as adding to Food items, Today’s menu list, and a chart which displays pie chart for each macro nutrient percentage for today’s food list.</li>
        <li>Created a web page that consists of a form that accepts inputs from users to create 100 boxes based on the choice of radio buttons.</li>
        <li>Implemented an application that gets a word through prompt and prints YES if it is a "palindrome string."</li>
        <li>Developed a smart home controller application by leveraging software design patterns and using Java libraries and legacy codes.</li>
        <li>Wrote a program in Java to check if the parentheses and brackets in the string are balanced. Balanced here meant: a left parenthesis/bracket always comes before a corresponding right parenthesis/bracket and thus can be closed by it; the left parentheses/brackets must be closed by the order they appear in the string (from left to right).</li>
        <li>Created a special binary search method: binarySearch(int[] nums, int target, boolean inclusive). "nums" is a sorted int array that may contain duplicate values, e.g., [1, 3, 3, 4]; "target" is the target value for you to search for; "inclusive" is a control flag.</li>
        <li>Implemented a single-page calendar app for browsers. The functions included: users able to add an event (date, time, description of event) to the calendar; raise an alert for upcoming events based on the offset time value for that event.</li>
        <li>Implemented a method in Java to merge these two lists by splicing together their nodes so that we can get a sorted list that contains all elements.</li>
